\begin{instruction}{RORI}{Rotate Right Immediate}
  \assembly{\mnemonic{} Rd, Ra, amount}
  \purpose{To perform a right rotate of a 16-bit integer in a register by a constant bit amount.}
  \restrictions{The \texttt{amount} may be between 0 and 15, inclusive.}
  \begin{remarks}
The assembler translates \texttt{\mnemonic} with \texttt{amount} of 0 to
\begin{alltt}
  MOV  Rd, Ra
\end{alltt}
and \texttt{\mnemonic} with any other \texttt{amount} to
\begin{alltt}
  ROTI Rd, Rd, (15 - amount)
\end{alltt}
  \end{remarks}
\end{instruction}
