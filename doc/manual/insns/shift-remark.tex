\begin{remarks}
The instruction encoding allows directly representing any \texttt{amount} between 1 and 8, inclusive. The assembler translates \texttt{\mnemonic} with \texttt{amount} of 0 to
\begin{alltt}
  MOV  Rd, Ra
\end{alltt}
and \texttt{\mnemonic} with \texttt{amount} greater than 8 to
\begin{alltt}
  \mnemonic Rd, Ra, 8
  \mnemonic Rd, Rd, (amount - 8)
\end{alltt}
\end{remarks}
